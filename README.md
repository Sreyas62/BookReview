# üìö Book Review API

A RESTful API for managing books and their reviews. Users can add books, leave reviews, and search through the collection.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 
- MongoDB
- Your favorite API testing tool (Postman recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the project
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 5000. You're good to go! üéâ

## ü§î Design Decisions

1. **Review System**: One review per user per book to maintain review quality and prevent spam

2. **Pagination**: Implemented for both books listing and reviews to handle large datasets efficiently

3. **Search**: Case-insensitive search across both title and author fields for better user experience

4. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with 1-hour token expiry for security

5. **Error Handling**: Descriptive error messages to help debug issues quickly

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
